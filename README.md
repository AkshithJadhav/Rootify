Rootify is an advanced web application designed to revolutionize plant identification and exploration. Built with Python and Flask, it combines AI capabilities and intuitive interfaces to offer users an engaging platform for discovering and learning about plants. The application is structured into three distinct pages, each serving a unique purpose to maximize user experience.
<h1>Objectives</h1>
1.	AI-Powered Plant Identification: Enable users to upload images of plants, which are analyzed through a seamless API integration. The AI provides detailed insights, including the plantâ€™s species, characteristics, and other relevant information.<br>
2.	Real-Time AI Interaction: Incorporate an interactive chat feature that allows users to engage in dynamic conversations. This feature addresses a wide range of plant-related queries, fostering learning and engagement.<br>
3.	Comprehensive Plant Categorization: Offer a visually organized page that displays a wide variety of plant categories and species. Users can explore individual categories to discover information about specific plants.<br>
4.	Geo-Located Plant Insights: Provides an interactive Indian map. This map allows users to explore plant species native to specific regions, presenting data interactively and intuitively.<br>
<br>
<h1>Modules</h1><br>
1.	Image Analysis Module: Facilitates the upload and processing of plant images to generate accurate and detailed information via Gemini AI.<br>
2.	Conversational AI Module: Integrates a chat system for real-time AI assistance, enriching the user experience by addressing queries dynamically.<br>
3.	Categorization Module: Displays plant categories and species with data fetched in real-time from the Trefle API, enabling organized exploration.<br>
4.	Geo-Located Plant Module: Utilizes the iNaturalist API to display region-specific plant data on an interactive map, enhancing geographical context in plant discovery.<br>
